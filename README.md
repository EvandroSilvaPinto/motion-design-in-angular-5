# MotionDesign with Angular 5 & Material Design


This is a quick project sample working with latest Angular versions as of 10/13/2017.

The project is based 100% on Gerard Sans medium [article](https://medium.com/google-developer-experts/angular-applying-motion-principles-to-a-list-d5cdd35c899e).

I reproduced his examples, and made it work with Angular 5 (v5.0.0-rc.2) and Angular Material Design (v2.0.0-beta.12).

## Setup

To make it work, clone the repo and `npm install` it.
